# Landing Page

This landing page features procedurally generated clouds, tree tops, and a snow capped mountain in a simple cartoonish design. 
The clouds flow right to left in parallax fashion giving the illusion of depth. 
The sun and the moon show up to date day an night positions and phases of the astronomical bodies.
There is further consideration to add weather and other celestial bodies in the future.

This application is built using HTML5, HTML Canvas, Sass, JavaScript, and a database.
